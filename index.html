   You can call me Jess or Jessica; my pronouns are she/her and singular they. I live on the unceded territory of the Semiahmoo Nation. As part of my commitment to unsettle Turtle Island, I redistribute 10% of my income to <a href="https://fncaringsociety.com/donate">support Indigenous children and families</a>. <p>Since 2002, I've written a trail of blogs across the internet (the first on Blogspot) and <a href="https://jessdriscoll.itch.io">a ten-year back catalogue of zines</a>. My first published book of nonfiction will be out in 2022 from <a href="https://microcosmpublishing.com">Microcosm Publishing</a>.</p>
