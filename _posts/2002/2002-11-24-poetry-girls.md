My creative writing class had a reading today. Lots of poetry girls with flowing skirts and berets. A little intimidating being the only prose writer up there. But I got a really nice reaction from a lot of people. I read the last two pages of sleep on the left side, leave the right side free. And I was a little nervous, but it felt so good to read it out loud. I'm falling back in love with this story.
