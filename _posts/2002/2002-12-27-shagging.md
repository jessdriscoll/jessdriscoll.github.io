>Everything I say is complete lies. Like, when people ask what 'Relax' was about, when it first came out we used to pretend it was about motivation, and really it was about shagging.
Mark O'Toole of Frankie Goes to Hollywood 

It reminds me of when I first realised what "Rave On" by John Mellencamp was about. I have a very clear memory of listening to it on a blanket in my friend's backyard. I was probably 10. "Rave On" is better hidden in dancing than "Relax" is in motivation. But I soon realised that every song is about shagging. 

Boxing Day is for A&B Sound's legendary sale. People start lining up the day before for this thing. But I just buy CDs, so I get to sleep in. I love what our music says about us: 
- Frankie Goes to Hollywood "Welcome to the Pleasuredome" 
- Blondie "Parallel Lines" 
- The Knack "Get the Knack" 
- David Bowie "David Bowie" 
- Elvis "30 #1s" 
- Kylie Minogue "Fever" 
- George Michael "Faith" 
- Rhett Miller "The Instigator" 
- Thrush Hermit "Clayton Park" 
- David Usher "Little Songs" 
- The Verve "No Come Down" 

I had to make up for getting no CDs for Christmas.
