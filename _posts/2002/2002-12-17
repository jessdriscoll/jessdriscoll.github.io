My best friend is in Mexico, by way of Las Vegas, and I just received the most wonderfully homoerotic Siegfried and Roy postcard in the mail.

- Ed is the Chinese guy, Larry is the white guy 
- Keanu Reeves played Ted, Bill was Alex Winter 
- you're on your own for Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, though
