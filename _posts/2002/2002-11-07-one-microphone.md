I catch myself in these moments; remind myself that I'm weird. I'm watching The Osbournes, wearing a Smallville t-shirt, reading Pride and Prejudice, listening to Erasure and waiting to go to a Neko Case concert.

Guy: Show us your boobs!  
Neko: You don't want to see me boobs. [pause for the protests to the contrary] Now, here's a song about the Lord.

One microphone. An acoustic guitar, a mandolin, a double bass and a banjo. Bluegrass country. And Jim and Jennie and the Pinetops are now my new favourite band. Which is strange given that my previous new favourite band was Hot Hot Heat. But I'm seeing them on Saturday. Their Strokes good looks and happy Strokes music just may turn me back around.
