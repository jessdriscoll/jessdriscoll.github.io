Do you know the last time I had action figures on my Christmas list? Neither do I. I'm not sure I ever asked for them. My brothers got Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ghostbusters every year. They got Leonardo and Michaelangelo; I got April, the girl, the reporter. They got Venkman and Spengler; I got Janine, the girl, the receptionist. There's a whole other feminist rant in there but that's not my thing. I've got action figure on my Christmas list this year. This time they're the main characters, not the sidekicks. They are the guys, but an argument could be made to the contrary. So, I walk into our local comic book store looking for the Smallville action figures, while wearing my Smallville High t-shirt. I manage to attract the service of the cutest comic book geek in the place. Of course, as a comic book geek, he cannot pass judgement over me. How do you explain to the people who don't know but who come right out and ask you? "I watch it, but in an ironic way." What the hell does that mean? I'm such a loser.

I eat all the ice in my glass. I only drink vodka and orange juice but I don't like ordering screwdrivers. I feel like a cliche using that word. I feel like I'm in Cocktail. It takes me an hour to finish a drink. I don't mind because it costs me $5.50. The busboys try to take my glass from me before I'm done. But I'm not done until all the ice is gone.
