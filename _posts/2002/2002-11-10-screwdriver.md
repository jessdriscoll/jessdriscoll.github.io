I eat all the ice in my glass. I only drink vodka and orange juice but I don't like ordering screwdrivers. I feel like a cliche using that word. I feel like I'm in Cocktail. It takes me an hour to finish a drink. I don't mind because it costs me $5.50. The busboys try to take my glass from me before I'm done. But I'm not done until all the ice is gone.
