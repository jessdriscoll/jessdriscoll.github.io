Robbie Williams has, in the past, been Freddie Mercury, Sean Connery, Frank Sinatra; and all without really losing himself. One of the few celebrities that understands the meaning of the word 'persona'. Bowie and Madonna are the obvious ones; the ones that are able to change themselves to what they need, want to be. But there are others who have a very defined public and private life. Ozzy Osbourne has recently been outed as the doting, if still profane, father figure. Adam Sandler has recently been outed as the good actor, but put that back in the closet for '8 Crazy Nights'. Chris Murphy - for my fellow Canadians - has always willingly took the role as 'leader' of Sloan. It seems on his latest album, Robbie is turning himself into a punk Elton John. 'Hot Fudge', maybe the best song on 'Escapology', has definite 'Good Bye Yellow Brick Road' overtones. Yet, somehow, he still remains himself. From the secret song: 'Why is there ketchup on my sleeve? You think that Adam fancied Eve? What if Eve could not conceive, And he had to breed with Steve? We'd all be gay...' At heart, he's still just a randy teenager.
