I'm watching Eli's Coming, the one where Steve Sisko is in Rebecca's office on a Saturday. I know there is a consensus that Josh is Dan and Dan is Josh, I don't necessarily disagree with that. But wouldn't Bradley Whitford have made a great Steve Sisko? Everyone loves him now, but remember all those great white yuppie asshole parts he used to play? I would have loved to have seen a confrontation between him and Josh Charles.
