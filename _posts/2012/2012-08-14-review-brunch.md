The pancakes I made last night were banana chocolate chip. I make them a lot. I always have bananas in my house. Half the bunch get eaten when perfectly ripe, sliced into cereal or onto peanut butter toast. The rest sit on top of the fridge while I eat the orchard apples I bought at the farmer's market or the pineapple that was on sale at the grocery store. When my bananas are spotted brown, that's when I make pancakes.

Some people make banana bread. I make banana bread, too. But to make banana bread, I want my mom's perfectly seasoned, perfectly sized loaf pans. That's what banana bread looks like to me. Pancakes, though, you can make pancakes anywhere. They require no special tools. No special skills. No futzing with yeast and proofing, no kneading and shaping, no worrying about the right order of ingredients. If you add too much flour, add some more liquid. That's OK. If you forget the salt, throw it in last. Your pancakes will be fine.

My recipe changes every day. Even when the same ingredients go in the bowl, they go in different quantities. This is how it goes when I’m making pancakes just for me. Mash one (1) banana with a fork and mix it with one (1) egg. Keep it chunky or stir it smooth. Pour in a splash of milk or cream or orange juice or water. Add rum, if you like. If you have a tub of yoghurt going bad, throw it in your pancakes. They’re the best way to clean out your fridge.

Flour next, and less than you think you need. A pancake batter should be loose. Baking powder, and don't forget the salt. Salt makes everything taste better, especially chocolate. Sometimes, I add oatmeal. Now's the time for chocolate chips. Fold it all together with a spatula. Don't overmix. Let it sit, if you're that patient. I'm not. I already have my pan hot and ready to go. I eat the first one with my fingers as soon as it’s done. When you make them right, pancakes don't need butter or syrup or even a fork.
