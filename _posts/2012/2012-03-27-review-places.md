[The first issue of The General Review is on sale!](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/the-general-review) As it is the first, this one is a collection of previously posted bits--a few of our favourite places. We're hoping to make this a monthly thing, so we welcome any feedback, and we would love to hear topic suggestions for future issues. April will be about stone fruit.

We didn't set out to start the Review. We set out to start a bakery. The General was founded in 2009 with an exchange which went something like this:

Jess: We should open a bakery.  

Megan: We should totally open a bakery! 

Opening a bakery, turns out, is really fucking hard to do. We started The General Review instead: a zine of food, ideas, and stories. Each issue of the Review is hyper-focused on one food-related noun, explored through memories, recipes, drawings, and lists.

If I’m looking for sushi, barbecue pork buns, or just a bowl of noodles, I have a hundred choices here in Vancouver, and they could all be good. Mexican, however, is a different story.

When I got back from Los Angeles, I asked friends if they knew a good taco place. I had fallen hard for the tacos there, the fish taco, in particular. So different from what we know up north, with the hard shells, the ground meat, the cheddar cheese; a real Mexican taco is a small bite with so much flavour. Anyone who tried to send me to Taco del Mar was summarily dismissed.

So I had to find La Taqueria on my own. A tiny place, in not the best neighbourhood, but it’s colourful inside, even on a Vancouver rainy day. I always want the pescado and carnitas, and this time, I tried the pollo con mole and al pastor. I even loved the pink pickled onions on top, and I don’t love pickled things or onions.

Small bites, small plates, small place. Big flavour. That’s what I love.

It’s never too late for a fresh start. Just be sure you get a good breakfast. Maybe somewhere new? Rather, somewhere very old.
I keep meaning to go to the Ovaltine Café. You’ve seen it before, the place with the sweet potato pie in Jose Chung’s From Outer Space. It’s still there, on Hastings, in the worst neighbourhood in Vancouver, in Canada, probably. Since 1943, the Ovaltine Café has been there, still with the neon, still with the lunch counter, still with the diner classics.

I was in Chinatown buying presents. The place is just up the street. Follow the neon. The customers have changed, more mismatched second-and-thirdhand clothes than men in hats and ladies in gloves.

But the waitresses treat everyone the same. Everyone needs a good breakfast. Everyone deserves a fresh start.
