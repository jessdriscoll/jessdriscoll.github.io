Time for the third issue of The General Review already? Wild! [In the June issue of The Review](http://jessdriscoll.com/blog/2012/06/06/review-oysters), Megan writes about discovering oysters and, also, that she wouldn't fare well in a shucking contest. Jess drew a whole page of oysters to accompany the essay and, also, a page of Megan's favourite oyster condiments. We have a special double issue planned for July and a launch from Los Angeles(!) when North goes South.
