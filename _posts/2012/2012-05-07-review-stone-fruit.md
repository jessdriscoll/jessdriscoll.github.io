Whether you like it or not, issue number two of The General Review is out! Brand new, never-before-posted-on-the-internet content all about how we stopped worrying and learned to love stone fruit. Megan wrote about pluots in SoCal, and Jess filled her pages with a silly drawing of a peach. Stay tuned for June and seafood.

I was a picky eater as a kid. I'm still picky, but now I eat sushi, and I didn't then. I eat Brussel sprouts and dill pickles and other green things I used to be weird about. But I'll never like shrimp, so don't even try.

I thought I didn't like cherries. Because I didn't like red Lifesavers or cherry Kool-Aid or those little red bits in fruit cake. Actually, I didn't like any of the bits in fruit cake. But maraschino cherries. Neon red and sticky sweet, they were made for garnish, the last ingredient to top a sundae, and the first to be eaten. I passed my cherries off to someone else at the table. The someone who didn’t get the dill pickle on top of my hamburger.

Everyone who packed a lunch to school remembers the days their mom sent a fruit cup. Mine came in little cans with the peel top lid. I ate the pears, the pineapple, the grapes, the peaches. I left the cherries behind.

I didn’t bother the cherries; the cherries didn’t bother me. Until a few summers ago, when my mom brought home a bag of Ranier cherries from the market. Bigger than maraschinos, lighter. Some are nearly white, with just a blush of red. They’re crispy and juicy. I didn’t know cherries could taste like this.

I even love the pits. Grapes with seeds are awful, a hassle, not worth the effort for a bit of fruit and pieces stuck in your teeth. A bag of cherries between two friends on a picnic blanket is a project, something to keep your hands busy when the conversation falls quiet, summer falls dark, and the fireworks crack overhead.
