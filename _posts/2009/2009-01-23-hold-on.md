Though I was 8 in 1990, I can tell you that Wilson Phillips was a girl group made up of the daughters of Brian Wilson and of John Phillips, and I can tell you their hit was called ["Hold on."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIbXvaE39wM) I could have told you that it might have sounded like this, because I know what the early nineties sounded like. But I actually have no specific memories of this song. I wasn't remembering "Hold on", not the sound of it. I was remembering it as a cultural point of reference, and I think I built some kind of composite 1990s sound in my head to go along with it. Isn't the brain wonderful?
