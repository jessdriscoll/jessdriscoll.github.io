[Focus.](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/focus) 

That's the word I chose for 2018. I chose it because it's hard for me. I was a gifted child, and now I'm an underperforming adult. I'm a 1981 Millennial who came of age alongside the internet. I'm typing this in the Notes app on my iPhone while lying in bed in the dark. Trust me when I tell you, I know how hard it is to focus. 

The game has one rule. You will lose a lot. You will win rarely. So remember, you can always try again. 

Rule #1: Do one thing at a time. 

The game is won when that one thing is completed. The game can be replayed by choosing another thing. 

Rule #1a: Life is supposed to be fun.
