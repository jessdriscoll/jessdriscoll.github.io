During 2021, with most jobs still not back to 2019 levels, the Canadian government extended employment insurance. Most months, I received $700 to make up my lost hours.

But that benefit ended this month. And my job is still diminished because, of course, the pandemic is not over. My students cannot be vaccinated. I’m not sure what will happen in 2022; I’m not sure if I’ll have to give up my apartment and move back in with my parents. Right now, all I can hope for is that the government realises that people still need help.

I have a lot of hobbies which pay me a little money, but none of this can be called “a living.” My whole life, I’ve been underemployed. Last year was the first time I had to pay taxes—and it was because the money the government gave me bumped me up a tax bracket. It was the first time in my life I made a living wage.

Last Sunday was the last farmers market of the season, as well as All Day Breakfast’s last market for a while. I won’t be back for 2022 because I need a break. Like most of you, I imagine, I need a break from life. The market is not only a lot of work, but it’s a lot of people.

I’m dreaming about hibernation in December.

My book is due at the end of November, so that’s where my brain is turning now. But when it’s done, a few weeks of nothing sounds so good.

But before then!

I'm writing a book, I'm doing a talk, and I'm planning to make a zine in November. Do you need a little encouragement to make something next month?

​NaMaZiMo is a tiny kick in the butt for your creativity. National Make a Zine Month means that if you make one zine, you win!

Don't worry about word count. Don't fret about perfection. Just make something already.

​On November 1st, at 5pm Pacific, I'll be talking about past zine challenges I've completed. Like in 2016, when I made a zine a week all year. Or in 2018, when I made a zine every day. I've challenged myself to write daily poems and daily reviews. There's so much creative energy in borders and restraints.

​Register at Eventbrite, and you'll get the link in your email on November 1st to join us for the kickoff to NaMaZiMo. And it's totally free!
