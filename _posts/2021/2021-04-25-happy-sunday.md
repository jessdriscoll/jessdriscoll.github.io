With dates confirmed and paid for, I can announce All Day Breakfast's market schedule! You might remember how I went back and forth on doing it again this year. We're still in a kind of lockdown here in BC, and now I'm writing a book this year. But I also didn't want to lose my momentum. I want to keep going when it would be so easy to quit. 

We'll be doing one Sunday a month, which equals six markets. I had been thinking about taking August off from my job (summers are slow for teaching anyway), and doing every week. Go all in for the summer months and see what doing ADB full-time might be like. 

But that was when I thought my province had this pandemic under control. I don't know what next week is going to look like, let alone next month. We're right back where we started in 2020, and the best thing I give myself is consistency, not a second job. A third job? I'm still writing a book due in November, too!

Starting at the end of next month, ADB will be at the White Rock Farmers Market on May 23, June 27, July 25, August 29, September 26, and October 24, closing day. We'll have the same sourdough starter kits with a brand new printed booklet. My main bake will be a sea salt foccacia in a couple of different sizes. My mom will have sewn and crocheted kitchen linens. My dad will have painted house and garden signs. 

It's hard to judge by 2020, when I started planning in January, then started selling in the middle of the pandemic. But I know I tried to do too much. This year, I've resolved to be kind to myself and do one thing only: sourdough. Let's see how it goes.

Most of you on this list won't have a chance to visit us at the market, I know. There will be photos on Instagram on market Sundays, and I'll send a letter after every one to let you know how it went. 

[And don't forget, the shop is always open online.](https://www.alldaybreakfast.org/)

Will see each other soon, I hope. 

PS. OK I know I said I'm only doing one thing, but if I add teaching, that doesn't count, right? That's my day job, so it's already a thing. But yes, this year, I want to try teaching some online baking classes, a chance for you to ask all kinds of questions about sourdough and bread (and maybe other DIY stuff?) Sound interesting?
