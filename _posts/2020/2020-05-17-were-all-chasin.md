I’ve been thinking that maybe I’m done with fiction. Not forever, but for now, and maybe for a while.

Projects are my jam. I like the structure of this many words, on these days, in this form. At the beginning of April, already more than half a month into my quarantine and growing bored, I thought I’d try writing a little story every day. April is good; there are only 30 days. 500 words would be easy for me; for [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/), I’ve done 1,667, and I did [750words](https://750words.com/) for years. I even decided to write fan fiction because half the work is done for you.

But I didn’t make it to the end of the month. I hardly made it to the end of the first week.

It’s a pandemic! What was I thinking, trying to set myself a deadline? Of course I wasn’t gonna succeed, and there’s no use feeling bad about it. Not like I was getting paid for the project, anyway. It was only fic.

Fan fiction wasn’t the first stories I wrote, but fandom is where I learned to write in public. I learned about feedback, editing, and collaboration with the other writers I met online, the ones who loved Smallville or Stargate: Atlantis as much as I did—which is to say, we saw the potential underneath the camp. I was already calling myself a writer, but now I was writing for other people. And they were reading what I wrote.

So I wrote more. I wrote my own stories. I sent them out to publishers who published the writers I knew in fandom, and they published them! It wasn’t a lot of money, but if I just wrote more stories, I could make more money, right?

I tried. For a lot of years, because I knew the stories of rejection eventually lead to an agent, a book, a career. I knew this because I saw it happen, for friends, IRL and online.

It hasn’t happened for me. But I choose that verb “hasn’t” purposefully. It hasn’t happened for me—yet. While I might feel old at 38, I know I’m young. I know there are years and years ahead for me to try again. But right now, I’m trying something different.

It’s been a long time since I’ve enjoyed writing like I have enjoyed writing these letters to you. In recent years, I’ve even struggled writing letters to my favourite friend, my best penpal, and I write those letters by hand. There’s an ocean between hand-writing and keyboard-writing (and then another channel between tangible and intangible keyboards). When I begin to doubt my skills, I go back to pen/cil and paper, and I remember, oh yeah, I can write.

This time around, these letters are doing the job. God damn, I can write. Maybe I should be writing non-fiction instead? But every time I think again about doing the freelance thing, a wave of media layoffs follows, and I wonder what’s the point? Trying to publish essays? In this pandemic economy?

There’s usually a photograph to break up the text in these letters, akin to the ephemeral-filled envelopes I mail out to friends. Once you get on my penpal list, you can expect unexpected packages to arrive, spilling out with zines, stickers, magazine cut-outs, and anything else that reminds me of you. And I almost included the book outline I hastily scribbled down earlier this week, but—after a lifetime of documenting my work online—I’m gonna hold that one close a little longer. Like my favourite, the mushroom, it needs time to grow in the darkness.

Instead of a photo, [here’s a one hour loop of Frank Ocean’s cover of “Moon River,”](https://youtu.be/0_o5lOralsg) which I’ve been listening to off and on this morning (I can’t really write with music).

After two Sundays at the market, I have today off (and it’s a gorgeous one, of course). [All Day Breakfast](http://alldaybreakfast.org/) will be back June 7th and 14th, and I’m very much looking forward to what I might bake. The garden is full of chives, popping open with purple seeds to ensure their return next year.

I hope I get to see you next year, too.
