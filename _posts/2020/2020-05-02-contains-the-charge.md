It’s cloudy today. A good day to stay inside with the oven on. I woke up before 7 this morning for the first time since my quarantine started. I’m taking it as a good sign. Today is Saturday, baking day, the day before [the White Rock Farmers Market](http://www.whiterockfarmersmarket.ca/) opens.

On Thursday, the last day of April, the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum put together an online concert of space songs. The show opened with one of my favourite songs of all-time, [“The Commander Thinks Aloud,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grPBYQ_a6Cg&feature=youtu.be&t=231) played by John Roderick on a grand piano in an empty Town Hall, church-turned-venue, in Seattle. In the background, stained glass, as well as his daughter, twirling to her own song. “The Commander” was written about [the Challenger disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster), which I’m too young to remember. But it’s actually about feeling faraway and watching the world go by. I listened to it a dozen times before I moved on to the rest of the show. (Stay to the end for Sting, doing a version of “Walking on the moon” by The Police.)

In a few minutes, I’m going to get up to make myself another chocolate chip pancake, spread it with peanut butter, (wish I had remembered to buy bananas yesterday), then put on [Victorian Farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ_C3Ja4awg&list=PLmQEL0DnjiRFV385j9nlqdnoo1zr3gnQv&index=14) to accompany me as I start baking. The dough was aging in the fridge until this morning, when I took it out to come up to temperature. I cut sheets of parchment for the loaf pans while the kettle boiled. My plan is a couple of loaves swirled with grape jelly (until the jelly runs out), then plain braids until the dough runs out. I made it with AP flour and rolled oats for a true breakfast vibe.

While those are proofing, I’ll mix up some more dough for foccacia with Spanish olive oil and rosemary, from my grandma’s garden. As a first market special, I made crumbs with all the bread I couldn’t eat, then seasoned them with my own sea salt, pepper, and oregano—also from the garden. There’s not a lot; that’s why it’s special. I have so! many! ideas! but I’m trying to restrain myself. I need a solid core of everyday products before I branch out.

While I was searching for [my photos from my 2019 Great Canadian Baking Show audition](https://www.instagram.com/p/B_kknyUhe8Z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), I discovered [this list](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0fe5976-e7af-43d9-bc1c-7d96e800cbe4_1125x1192.png).

October 14, 2019 is only the “last save” date. The idea of a bakery has burned much longer than that. It’s already been a decade since [Megan](https://www.instagram.com/meganwest/) and I came up with The General, which we turned into a blog and a zine, as we worked on the logistics of a physical space that crossed the border. [All Day Breakfast](http://alldaybreakfast.org/) is a new name, but it’s the same idea, the same dream.

Megan asked me last night if I was ready for Sunday. Elly asked me the same question this morning. The answer is “yes [but/and](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/but-and/) no.” I’ve done (am doing) what I can to “get” ready. But I won’t “feel” ready until my tent is up, my bread is on the table, my card reader is working, and the market officially opens. I might not even feel ready until the day is over, and I have a chance to figure out what needs to change for next weekend (May 10th!).

While I was searching for [the blog post](http://jessdriscoll.com/blog/2019/03/16/gcbs) I wrote after my GCBS audition, I found another post—[title: Baking](http://jessdriscoll.com/blog/2009/05/25/baking). That one was written May 25, 2009. Almost 11 years later, but I’m finally gonna go with it.
