[THE GENERAL REVIEW: ROSEMARY](https://jessdriscoll.itch.io/rosemary).

The Ligurian Focaccia	

During the plague year of 2020 (I recently learned that a “plague” means bacteria, not virus, so I’m using the metaphorical meaning here, not the scientific), those of us in quarantine have been stretched thin between digital connection and domestic arts. The internet is where the people are, but the kitchen is where I make comfort. For most of the year, I’ve been baking bread. Perhaps I should have been mixing potions instead.
	
During the plague years of the 1300s, the people looked everywhere, even their kitchens, for relief. To ward off the Black Death, some used a vinegar solution of herbs and spices. While there are certainly medicinal qualities in plants, the Four Thieves Vinegar probably did little more than block the smell of death.

>“Take three pints of strong white wine vinegar, add a handful of each of wormwood, meadowsweet, wild marjoram and sage, fifty cloves, two ounces of campanula roots, two ounces of angelic, rosemary and horehound and three large measures of camphor. Place the mixture in a container for fifteen days, strain and express then bottle. Use by rubbing it on the hands, ears and temples from time to time when approaching a plague victim.”
  
In my cupboards right now, I have sage, cloves, and rosemary. Marjoram and angelica seeds are easy to find at most grocery stores, and I’m always on the lookout for interesting recipes.
	
Early on in my farmers market experiment, I decided that the bread I sold would be plain. It would be sourdough, and I would sell dried starter alongside, so the flavour deserved to be the main character. I would also have salt to sell, made with sea water I had collected from one of the many local beaches surrounding White Rock. 

To sell the sourdough starter, I would bake sourdough bread. To sell the sea salt, I would bake focaccia.
	
It seemed my customers at the farmers market liked the whole wheat sourdough loaves I made. It seemed they preferred savoury flavours over the sweet. It seemed to me that a classic rosemary focaccia would be the ideal.
	
One market Sunday, a customer stopped to inspect the dinner plate-sized focaccia I was selling, topped with my sea salt. He asked if they were pizza crusts. He explained that focaccia must be thick and held his thumb and index finger apart to show just how thick he meant. I conceded his point, but he didn’t buy any loaves.
	
The bright spots of 2020 have been my farmers market Sundays and The Old Guard, and the two of them came together, unexpectedly, with this focaccia recipe. The Old Guard was released on Netflix on July 10. My friends online started talking about it right away. Suddenly, we had a new fandom, a necessary hyper-fixation that wasn’t coronavirus.
	
There’s an Italian character in this movie, from Genoa specifically, the capital of the Ligurian region. So when Megan sent me a recipe for Ligurian focaccia, it was both 2020 bright spots, baked together in a pan.
	
This recipe uses salt in three ways. It’s in the dough, as salt should be in every dough you mix up—sweet or savoury. It’s sprinkled on top, as salt should be on almost everything before you bake it. And there’s salt in the brine for the dough to soak in as it proves. This is what makes Ligurian focaccia its own thing.
	
I don’t know why focaccia needs to have rosemary on top. But if rosemary is the flower for remembrance, if salt is necessary for life, and if bread stands for hearth and home, then a warm loaf on your table is the comfort we all need at the end of 2020.
